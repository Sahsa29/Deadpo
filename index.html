<p>Deadpool, real name Wade Winston Wilson [1] is a fictional character, the anti-hero comic book by Marvel Comics [2], created by the artist Rob Layfield and writer Fabian Nitsieza and first appeared in The New Mutants comics # 98 (February 1991)). Called "The Bold Mercenary", the character has a non-standard, extremely cynical sense of humor.

Like Wolverine of the X-Men, Deadpool was subjected to the "Weapon X" program. After the scientists tried to heal his cancer, by instilling in his cells the ability to regenerate, Deadpool remained disfigured and mentally unstable. Initially appeared, like many other characters, in the main Marvel Universe, he subsequently received alternative versions existing in other Multiverse realities, including the "Age of Apocalypse" and the Ultimate Universe.

Initially, Deadpool acted as the opponent of the New Mutants, and then the "Force X" team, despite the love for the Siren from the last team. In 1997, the hero received his own series of comics, which became famous because of the main character's understanding that he is a comic book character. In 2002, after 69 numbers and the death of the protagonist during the explosion, the series was replaced by a comic about the Agent X, in which were the same minor heroes, and throughout the 15 numbers Deadpool was mentioned. In recent issues, he returned, but the comic book ended in 2003. In May 2004, the Cable  Deadpool series began, in which Deadpool acted in the lead roles along with the anti-hero mutant Cable. This series ended with number 50, as Cable began its own new series. In the summer of 2008, a new single series of Deadpool started, and in 2009 Deadpool appeared in the movie "X-Men: Beginning." Wolverine".</p>
